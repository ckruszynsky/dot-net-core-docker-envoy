# User Secrets

## Creating a User Secret
1. Open up the .csproj file 
    
2. Add a new node to property group called <UserSecretsId></UserSecretsId>
    
3. Give the value of a unique identifier; I prefer to use the pattern <AppName>-<UniqueId>

4. Next open the command line 
    
5. Run the following command 
    
        dotnet user-secrets set "[KEY]" "[VALUE]"
    * For the key value pass in a kestrel path so when it is passed into kestrel, it is translated into where the value belongs 
        
            ex: "Kestrel:Certificates:Development:Password"
    
     in the example above the key instructs to kestrel that the value is for the development password


## User Secrets file location
You can find the user secrety file that is generated by going to the following path:

    C:\users\[UserName]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\UserSecrets

and you will find a folder with the same name of your UserSecretsId you specified.
